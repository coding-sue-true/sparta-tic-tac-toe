# JQuery Selectors and Events - TicTacToe


## Main

The main task of this homework was to build a Tic Tac Toe game, using JQuery.
The code used in here was the solution code. I only got it working on the console and not on the screen.
There's also a version of the code in JavaScript provided by our Mentor.

## Homework Description

You challenge is build the game TicTacToe in the browser using JQuery. We will give you the html layout for the game. We will need you to use what you have learnt so far with selecting things with JQuery and creating event listeners with JQuery to create this game.

Your deliverables:-

1) Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2) Me and Joe added as contributors
3) Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4) pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5) The game should display the correct 'X' or 'Y' for each button pressed in the browser
6) Once a tile has been clicked it should not be able to be clicked again
7) The clear button should clear the board
8) When a winning condition is present you should display a winner, either X or Y
9) The program should use functions, loops, JQuery selectors and JQuery events

### List of what was delivered
6/9 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9)

### Most Difficult
* Clear vision of how to write the code
* Still difficult to know where to start
* Global variables are also still difficult to achieve (in terms of what I really need to be global for the game to start)
* Switching from moveOne to moveTwo

### What went well
* Add the right class to the element
* Although it's not working, pseudo code was easier to write
